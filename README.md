## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
* npm (v8 or higher recommended)
* MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas account)
* Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd nexamart-ecommerce # Or whatever your project root folder is called
```

2. Backend Setup
Navigate to the server (or backend) directory:

```bash
cd server
```

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the server directory and add the following environment variables:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=a_very_strong_and_secret_key_for_jwt
PORT=5000
```
Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your MongoDB URI (e.g., from MongoDB Atlas).

Replace a_very_strong_and_secret_key_for_jwt with a unique, strong secret key.

Start the backend server:


```Bash
npm start

# Or if you have nodemon installed:
# nodemon server.js
```
The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal and navigate to the client (or frontend) directory:

```Bash
cd ../client
Install frontend dependencies:
```

```Bash
npm install
```

Create a .env file in the client directory and add the following environment variable:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
This points your frontend to your local backend.

Start the frontend development server:

```Bash
npm run dev
The frontend application will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:5173 (or another available port).
```

## üåç Deployment
This project can be deployed using free-tier services:

Database: MongoDB Atlas (M0 Sandbox)

Backend: Render (Free Web Services)

Frontend: Netlify or Vercel (Free Static Site Hosting)

Refer to the documentation of each service for detailed deployment instructions. Remember to update your backend's CORS settings and frontend's REACT_APP_API_URL to reflect your deployed URLs.
